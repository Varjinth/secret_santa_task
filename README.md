# secret_santa_task


This project automates the **Secret Santa gift exchange process**. It ensures a fair and randomized assignment of gift recipients ("secret children") to employees, following business constraints and using a modular, extensible, and testable Python-based design.

## 📘 Overview

### 🎯 Objective

- To build a system that reads a CSV file of employee data and assigns each employee a unique secret child.
- To ensure **no employee is assigned to themselves**.
- To ensure **no employee is assigned the same person as last year** (if previous assignment data is provided).
- To ensure **one-to-one mapping** — each employee gives and receives exactly one gift.
